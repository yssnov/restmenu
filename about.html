      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>God loves the Trinity restaurant was established in 2018 with a simple mission: to create a place where
        people can come together to share exceptional food in a peaceful, welcoming atmosphere. Our name
        reflects our belief that dining is one of life's most sacred experiences.</p>

      <p>We started as a small family business with big dreams. Our founders, Maria and Giuseppe Benedetto,
        immigrated from Italy with traditional recipes passed down through generations. They wanted to share not
        just their food, but their culture and values with the community.</p>

      <p class="highlighted-text">Today, we continue to honor those traditions while embracing new culinary
        innovations.</p>
